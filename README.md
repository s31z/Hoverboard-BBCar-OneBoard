# Hoverboard-BBCar-OneBoard
One board (PCB) design for 4WD Bobbycars based on the popular hoverboard motors

## Goal
Goal of this project is to build a PCB and custom firmware for controlling 4 hoverboard motors for use in a Bobbycar or similar vehicle.
This erases the need to use two existing hoverboard PCBs, which saves on space and allows for new possibilities (torque vectoring, turning on the spot etc.)

## Parts
- Mostly same parts which are used in hoverboards
- Controller from the STM32F family (hoverboards use STM32F103RCT) for easier firmware adaptation
